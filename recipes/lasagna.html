    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian pasta dish. It is a baked casserole with layers of pasta, cheese, meat, or vegetables, and sauce. It has become a global favorite, with variations enjoyed in diverse cultures and cuisine</p>
    <p>Lasagna can be customized to individual preferences and dietary restrictions. While traditional recipes typically call for ricotta cheese, cottage cheese can be substituted for a lighter version. </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce: Cook onion in olive oil, then add ground beef and sausage, browning and draining excess fat. Stir in garlic, then add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Add pasta sauce, seasonings, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: Combine ricotta or cottage cheese, egg, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix.</li>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles (if using regular noodles): Boil noodles in salted water according to package directions, drain, and rinse with cold water. Skip if using no-boil noodles.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread about 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer with noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, and about 1.5 cups of meat sauce. Repeat the layers twice more, ending with noodles and meat sauce. Top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna: Cover with foil (spraying underside) and bake for 30-45 minutes for cooked noodles, or 45-50 minutes for no-boil noodles. Remove foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes until bubbly and golden. Broil for 2-3 minutes for a crispy topping.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for at least 15-20 minutes before cutting</li>
